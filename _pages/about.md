Greetings! I am Denghui Zhang.

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Data Mining at [Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/), working with Prof. [Hui Xiong](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=cVDF1tkAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). I am a member of the [Rutgers Data Mining Lab](http://datamining.rutgers.edu/CDMBA/). 
<!-- Prior to UIUC, I got my master's degree from [Institute of Computing Technology](http://www.ict.ac.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.cas.cn/) in 2018, and received my bachelor's degree from [University of Science and Technology Beijing](http://www.ustb.edu.cn/index.asp) with Beijing Outstanding Undergraduate Award in 2015. -->
<!-- My research interests lie in the general area of Natural Language Processing, with a special focus on multimedia knowledge extraction and knowledge-aware generation. -->
<!-- My research interests lie in solving interesting real-world problems in a data-driven way, e.g., representation learning for talent and job analysis, spatio-temporal modeling for turbulence forecasting. -->
<!-- More recently, I work on Natural Language Understanding, with a special focus on knowledge-enhanced language model pre-training. -->
<!-- I am also interested in Natural Language Understanding and knowledge graph, with a special focus on knowledge-enhanced language model pre-training. -->
My research interests mostly lie in representation learning, i.e., automating feature learning from data without annotation effort, by designing sophisicated self-supervised tasks. 
With the emergence of domain-oriented data and tasks, we are interested to incorporate human heuristic domain knowledge into the process of learning representations, so to a build "human + AI" system to tackle very specific challenges in multiple domains.
Interesting domain applications we concerned include: graph representation for talent intelligence, domain-oriented language representation, etc.
