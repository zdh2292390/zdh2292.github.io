**Greetings! I am an assistant professor at [Stevens Institute of Technology](https://www.stevens.edu/).**

<!-- I'm actively looking for Ph.D. students to work with me in AI-driven business analytics. Feel free to shoot me an email with your CV. Once we have a commitment to each other, I will exert my utmost effort to help you! -->

I'm actively looking for Ph.D. students to work with me in data science and LLM for business analytics. Feel free to shoot me an email with your CV. Once we have a commitment to each other, I will exert my utmost effort to help you!

I received my Ph.D. at [Rutgers University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutgers_University#Rankings), advised by Prof. [Hui Xiong](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=cVDF1tkAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).
My research interests lie in the intersection of data mining, natural langauge processing and business intelligence. More recently, I study the interaction between **LLM, business, ethics, social impact and innovation.**

<!-- I am interested in two types of research philosophy: (i) empower AI models with human domain knowledge, i.e., leverage domain knowledge to design new AI models for domain sciences (e.g., Talent Analytics and FinTech); (ii) leverage AI to discover new knowledge, i.e., apply machine learning to interpret societal phenomena and derive managerial implications to guide decision-making. -->

<!-- Specifically, my research focuses on **domain knowledge inspired deep representation learning** to fuse diverse knowledge sources (e.g., graph-structured knowledge, text semantic, and formula knowledge, etc) for complex domain adaptation.
My work is primarily related to the following topics,
-  **ML Methodologies:** Graph Representation Learning, Text Representation Learning, Reinforcement Learning.  
-  **Domain Applications:** Career Network Analysis, Employee Turnover Prediction, Venture Capital Portfolio Generation, E-commerce Product Linkage.  -->


My work has been published in top venues of data mining, artificial intelligence and information systems, including refereed journals (**IEEE TKDE, IEEE BigData**) and conference proceedings (**KDD, AAAI, ICDM, CIKM, CIST**, etc.). Some of my working papers are under review for **UTD and FT50 journals**.
