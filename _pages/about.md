<!-- Greetings! I am Denghui Zhang. -->

Denghui Zhang is a 5th-year Ph.D. student in Information Systems at [Rutgers University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutgers_University#Rankings), working with Prof. [Hui Xiong](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=cVDF1tkAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). He is a member of the [Rutgers Data Mining Lab](http://datamining.rutgers.edu/CDMBA/). 
<!-- My research interests mostly lie in self-supervised representation learning, i.e., automating feature learning from data with little annotation effort by designing customized self-supervised tasks. 
With the emergence of domain-oriented data and tasks, we are interested to incorporate human heuristic domain knowledge into the process of learning representations, so to a build "human + AI" system to tackle very specific challenges in multiple domains.
Interesting domain applications we concerned include: graph representation for talent intelligence, domain-oriented language representation, etc. -->

<!-- My research interests lie  -->
<!-- His research interests lies in the intersection of data mining and business intelligence. -->
His research interests lie in the intersection of data mining and business intelligence.
<!-- He is fascinated with two application domains, i.e., business and management, in which he studies problems including online labor market analysis, career transition pattern mining, intelligent job benchmarking, post-M&A turnover prediction, Venture Capital strategy optimization, e-commerce product linkage, e-commerce text analysis, etc. -->
Specifically, he is interested in two types of research: (i) **empower AI models with domain knowledge for business analytics**, i.e., leverage domain knowledge to design new AI models for business and management problems; (ii) **leverage AI to discover new domain insights**, i.e., apply machine learning to interpret certain business phenomena and derive managerial implications to guide business decision making.
From application perspective, he studies real-world problems including online labor market analysis, intelligent job benchmarking, post-M&A turnover prediction, Venture Capital strategy optimization, e-commerce product linkage and text analysis, etc. 
In terms of data mining methodology, he studies graph representation learning, self-supervised learning, knowledge graphs, large-scale language models, as well as their adaptation to business and management domains.
<!-- His general research agenda is incorporating domain knowledge to design new AI models to improve their predictive power; applying data mining techniques to understand economic phenomena and discover domain insights that provide business values. -->

His work has been published in top venues of data mining, artificial intelligence and information systems, including refereed journals (IEEE TKDE, IEEE BigData) and conference proceedings (KDD, AAAI, ICDM, CIKM, CIST, etc.). He has serveral working papers in preparation for UTD journals (ISR, Management Science).
